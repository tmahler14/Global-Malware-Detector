# Global Malware Detector Using Message Passing

authors: Timothy Mahler, Atreya Misra

This repository contains the .ipynb and data files relevant to the final project for EE382V SECURITY HRDWARE-SFTWRE INTERF at the University of Texas at Austin for Fall 2018.

Our global malware detector classifies files (nodes) as malicious using a message passing algorithm on the global graph of downloader files.

## Files

- project/ folder contains all relevant .ipynb files used to construct the global graph from the data, construct random graphs, and run our algorithm

- data/ folder contains ONLY SOME of the necessary data to run our algorithm. We could not upload all of the data given github's 100MB data limit
